# Mass-Spectrometry-Proteomics-Data-Analysis
The project aims to determine how unsupervised machine learning can be applied to time series based mass spectrometry data collected from hepatic nuclei. 
Currently, the study is applying the k means clustering method to the fold change of each protein.
It is hypothesized that this will result in clusters of functionally similar proteins in hepatic nuclei, providing novel research targets for further study.
Working on adding DBSCAN clustering and perhaps even K nearest neighbor classification to look for specific nuclear localization trends.
